# PyCalc
A simple calculator made with Python.
What ever Math Class throws at you, PyCalc can Do.

# Notes
1.0 and 1.1 are the same other than the fact that 1.0 has Looping done with a Function  
I plan on making it a GUI program with grafics and all kinds of files so 1.1 and other single file versions will be found in the Classic branch  
As of now, PyCalc is very basic
